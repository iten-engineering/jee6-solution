# Setting up EJB client context properties
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A EJB client context is a context which contains contextual information for carrying out remote 
# invocations on EJBs. This is a JBoss specific API. The EJB client context can be associated with 
# multiple EJB receivers. Each EJB receiver is capable of handling invocations on different EJBs.
#
# Further Details see:
# https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/EJB+invocations+from+a+remote+client+using+JNDI

# The "remote.connectionprovider.create.options." property prefix can be used to pass the options 
# that will be used while create the connection provider which will handle the "remote:" protocol. 
# In this example we use the "remote.connectionprovider.create.options." property prefix to pass 
# the "org.xnio.Options.SSL_ENABLED" property value as false. That property will then be used 
# during the connection provider creation. 
remote.connectionprovider.create.options.org.xnio.Options.SSL_ENABLED=false

# This is where you define the connections that you want to setup for communication with the remote 
# server. The "remote.connections" property uses a comma separated value of connection "names". 
# The connection names are just logical and are used grouping together the connection configuration 
# properties later on in the properties file. 
# The example above sets up a single remote connection named "default". There can be more than 
# one connections that are configured.
remote.connections=default

# As you can see we are using the "remote.connection.<connection-name>." prefix for specifying the 
# connection specific property. The connection name here is "default".
# We are setting the "host" property of that connection to point to localhost. Similarly we set 
# the "port" for that connection to 4447.
# By default AS7 uses 4447 as the remoting port. The EJB client API uses the remoting port for 
# communicating with the server for remote invocations, so that's the port we use in our client 
# programs (unless the server is configured for some other remoting port)
remote.connection.default.host=localhost
remote.connection.default.port = 4447
remote.connection.default.connect.options.org.xnio.Options.SASL_POLICY_NOANONYMOUS=false
